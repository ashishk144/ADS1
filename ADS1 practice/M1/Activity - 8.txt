There are 4 different techniques to solve the given problem. They are -
Quick find
Quick Union
Weighted Quick Union
Weighted Quick Union with Path Suppression
Of all the above mentioned methods, the fourth one is the most optimal method for the following reasons -
The complexity of this method is lg*N.
The computation time of the program reduces drastically
It makes the final tree as flat as possible. This reduces the time taken to check the final tree.
